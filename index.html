A history of surfing
</h1>

<p>
  {{More footnotes|date=August 2015}}
  The riding of [[wind waves|waves]] has likely existed since humans began swimming in the [[ocean]]. In this sense, [[bodysurfing]] is the oldest type of wave-catching. Standing up on what is now called a [[surfboard]] is a relatively recent innovation developed by the [[Polynesians]].The influences for modern [[surfing]] can be directly traced to the surfers of [[Ancient Hawaii|pre-contact Hawaii]].

  [[File:Kahaluu Canoe Landing.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Kahaluu Bay|Kahalu{{okina}}u Bay]] was the site of an ancient surfing temple.]]

  == Polynesian origins ==

  The art of surfing, known as ''enalu'' in the [[Hawaiian language]], was first discovered by Joseph Banks on the [[HMS Endeavour]] during the first voyage of [[James Cook]], during the ship's stay in [[Tahiti]]. Surfing was a central part of ancient [[Polynesian culture]] and predates European contact.  The chief (Ali'i) was traditionally the most skilled wave rider in the community with the best board made from the best wood. The ruling class had the best beaches and the best boards, and the commoners were not allowed on the same beaches, but they could gain prestige by their ability to ride the surf on their boards.

  The sport was also recorded in print by other European residents and visitors who wrote about and photographed [[Samoa]]ns surfing on planks and single canoe hulls; Samoans referred to surf riding as ''fa'ase'e'' or ''se'egalu.'' Edward Treager also confirmed Samoan terminology for surfing and surfboards in Samoa. Oral tradition confirms that surfing was also practiced in [[Tonga]], where the late king [[Taufa'ahau Tupou IV]] was the foremost Tongan surfer of his time.

  == Pre-Incan origins and debate ==

  The practice of riding a vessel with a wave was practiced since the Pre-Incan civilization (Mochica/[[Moche culture]]) around 2000 years ago and continued in the [[Chimu culture]]. The vessels the Mochica people used were called
  "[[Caballitos de Totora]]", ('Straw SeaHorses'). Although the Mochica used the Caballitos de Totora for fishing purposes, it is also possible that they were used for fun, as their archaeology suggests. It is also likely that the Mochica people did in fact 'surf for fun' given that the longest rideable wave of world 'Chicama' was within their empire.<ref>http://briancampagna.com/chicama-peru/</ref> [[Puerto Chicama|Chicama]] is located in Puerto Malabrigo, La Libertad, close to the city of Trujillo, Peru. To this day Caballitos de Totora are still used by local fishermen and can be also be ridden by tourists for recreational purposes.

  It is questioned whether this is the first observed form of surfing, given that the Mochica/Chimu also used a paddle/stick to displace themselves in the ocean, thus the Caballito de Totora has a closer resemblance to Stand-Up Paddle boarding than surfing.

  ==Ancient Hawaii==
  The [[Ancient Hawaii]]an people did not consider surfing a mere recreational activity, [[hobby]], [[extreme sport]], or [[career]] as it is viewed today. Rather, the Hawaiian people integrated surfing into their [[culture]] and made surfing more of an [[art]] than anything else.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} They referred to this art as ''he{{okina}}e nalu'' which translates into [[English language|English]] as “wave sliding.” The art began before entering the mysterious ocean as the Hawaiians prayed to the gods for protection and strength to undertake the powerful mystifying ocean. If the ocean was tamed, frustrated surfers would call upon the ''[[kahuna]]'' (priest), who would aid them in a surfing prayer asking the gods to deliver great surf. Prior to entering the ocean, the priest would also aid the surfers (mainly of the upper class) in undertaking the spiritual ceremony of constructing a surfboard.

  Hawaiians would carefully select one of three types of trees. The trees included the ''koa'' (''[[Acacia koa]]''), ''{{okina}}ulu'' (''[[Breadfruit|Artocarpus altilis]]''), and ''[[wiliwili]]'' (''Erythrina sandwicensis'') trees. Once selected, the surfer would dig the tree out and place fish in the hole as an offering to the gods. Selected craftsmen of the community were then hired to shape, stain, and prepare the board for the surfer. There were three primary shapes: the ''{{okina}}olo'', ''kiko{{okina}}o'', and the ''[[alaia]]''. The ''{{okina}}olo'' is thick in the middle and gradually gets thinner towards the edges. The ''kiko{{okina}}o'' ranges in length from {{convert|12|-|18|ft|m}} and requires great skill to maneuver. The ''alaia'' board is around {{convert|9|ft|m}} long and requires great skill to ride and master. Aside from the preparatory stages prior to entering the water, the most skilled surfers were and pastors,[please clarify] including chiefs and warriors that surfed amongst the best waves on the island. These upper class Hawaiians gained respect through their enduring ability to master the waves and this art the Hawaiians referred to as surfing.<ref>{{cite web |author=Veronica Britton |url=http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring04/Britton/default.htm |year=2004 |title=The Sport of Kings |accessdate=2009-11-07 |publisher= [[University of Florida]] Interactive Media Lab }}</ref>

  In July 1885, three teenage Hawaiian princes took a break from their boarding school, St. Mathew’s Hall in San Mateo, and came to cool off in Santa Cruz, California. There, David Kawananakoa, Edward Keliʻiahonui and Jonah Kūhiō Kalaniana'ole surfed the mouth of the San Lorenzo River on custom-shaped redwood boards, according to surf historians Kim Stoner and Geoff Dunn.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gtweekly.com/santa-cruz-news/good-times-cover-stories/936-riders-of-the-sea-spray.html|title=Riders of the Sea Spray - Santa Cruz Good Times|author=GTWebmaster|publisher=|accessdate=8 November 2014}}</ref>
  In 1907 [[George Freeth]] was brought to California from Hawaii, to demonstrate surfboard riding as a publicity stunt to promote the opening of the Los Angeles-Redondo-Huntington railroad owned by [[Henry E. Huntington|Henry Huntington]], who gave his name to Huntington Beach. Freeth surfed at the [[Huntington Beach, California|Huntington Beach]] pier and travelled up and down the coast demonstrating surfing and life guard skills.

  Surfing on the East Coast of the United States began in [[Wrightsville Beach]], [[North Carolina]] in 1909 when Burke Haywood Bridgers and a colony of surfers introduced surfing to the East Coast.<ref>''Pacific Commercial Advertiser'' (Honolulu, Hawaiian Islands) 1885-1921, April 7, 1910, Image 3.

  ==Australian surfing==

  In 1910, Tommy Walker returned to Manly Beach, Sydney, with a 10-foot surfboard "bought at Waikiki Beach, Hawaii, for two dollars."<ref>The Referee Thursday, 23 February 1939, page 16.</ref> Walker became an expert rider and in 1912 gave several exhibitions in Sydney.<ref>The Daily Telegraph 27 January 1912, page 21.</ref>

  Surfboard riding received national exposure with the exhibitions by Hawaiian Duke Kahanamoku in the summer of 1914-1915 at several Sydney beaches. As a current Olympic sprint champion, Kahanamoku was invited to tour the Eastern states for an extensive series of swimming carnivals and at his first appearance in the Domain Pool, Sydney, smashed his previous world record for 100 yards by a full second.<ref>The Referee, 6 January 1915, page 16.</ref>
  Following the first exhibition at Freshwater on 24 December 1914,<ref>The Sun, Thursday 24th December 1914 page 6.</ref> in the New Year Kahanamoku demonstrated his skill at Freshwater and Manly,<ref>The Sun, 11th January 1915, page 6.</ref> followed by appearances at Dee Why<ref>The Sun, 6th February 1915 page 6.</ref> and Cronulla.<ref>The St. George Call, 13 February 1915, page 5.</ref>

  Duke Kahanamoku's board is now on display in the Freshwater Surf Life Saving Club, Sydney, Australia.<ref>{{cite book |title=Freshie: Freshwater Surf Life Saving Club - A 100 year history: 1908 - 2008 |author=Pauline Curby |url= http://www.freshwaterslsc.com/book/ |date=November 2007 }}</ref>

  ==Modern surfing==
  Around the start of the 20th century, Hawaiians living close to [[Waikiki]] began to revive surfing, and soon re-established surfing as a sport. The revival is linked to real estate development and efforts to boost tourism.<ref>{{cite web |title= Inside the Curl: Surfing's Surprising History |date= August 2, 2013 |url= http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/08/130803-surfing-surprising-history-hawaiian-culture-extreme-sports/}}</ref> Duke Kahanamoku, "Ambassador of Aloha," [[Olympic Games|Olympic medalist]], and avid waterman, helped expose surfing to the world. Kahanamoku's role was later memorialized by a 2002 first class letter rate postage stamp of the United States Postal Service.<ref>{{cite web

  }}</ref> Author [[Jack London]] wrote about the sport after having attempted surfing on his visit to the islands. Surfing progressed tremendously in the 20th century, through innovations in board design and ever increasing public exposure.

  Surfing's development and culture was centered primarily in three locations: [[Hawaii]], [[Australia]], and [[California]], although the first footage of surfing in the UK was in 1929 by Louis Rosenberg and a number of friends after being fascinated by watching some Australian surfers. In 1959 the release of the film [[Gidget]], based on the life of surfer [[Kathy Kohner-Zuckerman]], boosted the sport's popularity immensely, moving surfing from an [[Subculture|underground culture]] into a national [[fad]] and packing many surf breaks with sudden and previously unheard of crowds. [[B-movie]]s and [[surf music]] such as the [[Beach Boys]] and [[Surfaris]] based on surfing and Southern California beach culture ([[Beach Party film]]s) as it exploded, formed most of the world's first ideas of surfing and surfers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}  This conception was revised again in the 1980s, with newer mainstream portrayals of surfers represented by characters like Jeff Spicoli from ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]''.

  [[File:Oxnard, Ormond Beach surfing 1975.jpg|thumb|Surfing at Ormond Beach in [[Oxnard]], California, in 1975]]
  The anonymous sleeve notes on the 1962 album ''Surfin' Safari'', the first album to be released on the Capitol label by The Beach Boys, include a rather tongue-in-cheek description of the sport of surfing thus:<blockquote>"For those not familiar with the latest craze to invade the sun-drenched Pacific coast of Southern California, here is a definition of "surfing" - a water sport in which the participant stands on a floating slab of wood, resembling an ironing board in both size and shape, and attempts to remain perpendicular while being hurtled toward the shore at a rather frightening rate of speed on the crest of a huge wave (especially recommended for teen-agers and all others without the slightest regard for either life or limb)."</blockquote>

Regardless of its usually erroneous portrayal in the media, true surfing culture continued to evolve quietly by itself, changing decade by decade. From the 1960s fad years to the creation and evolution of the [[shortboard|short board]] in the late 60s and early 70s to the performance hotdogging of the neon-drenched 1980s and the epic professional surfing of the 1990s (typified by [[Kelly Slater]], the "[[Michael Jordan]] of Surfing"). In 1975, professional contests started.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.surfingwalkoffame.com/woman/Oberg.html|title=Woman of the Year|publisher=|accessdate=8 November 2014}}</ref> That year [[Margo Oberg]] became the first female professional surfer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.surfingwalkoffame.com/woman/Oberg.html|title=Woman of the Year|publisher=|accessdate=8 November 2014}}</ref>

[[Surf film|Surfing documentaries]] have been one of the main ways in which [[surf culture|surfing culture]] grows and replenishes itself, not just as a sport but as an art form, the style and quality of surf films have often tracked well the evolution of the sport.
